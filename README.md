# iNET
The fully-functional iServer for PHP! (Based off @PocketMine , @ClearSky , and @iTXTech Genisys)
## Notes
- You will need to provide your own PHP binary. Make sure it is PHP5.
- To start the program, open powershell or command prompt, and run `start YOUR PHP.exe DIRECTORY src/pocketmine/PocketMine.php --enable-ansi %*`
(Your PHP.EXE directory being the directory for PHP.)
- If you have any trouble with starting the console, use [THIS](https://github.com/thelucyclub/BetterConsole/)
- It is recomended to install a program such as [ClearSky](https://github.com/ClearSkyTeam/Installer/archive/master.zip) and then replace the `src` folder from that with this one.
